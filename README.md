# Fibonacci Algorithm

Simple and efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

This repository provides an optimized iterative implementation with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

## Usage

```python
from fibonacci import fibonacci

# Calculate the 10th Fibonacci number
result = fibonacci(10)  # Returns 55
```

## Implementation

The main implementation uses an iterative approach, which is:
- **Fast**: O(n) time complexity
- **Memory efficient**: O(1) space complexity
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and maintain
